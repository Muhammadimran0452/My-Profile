# Introduction 
My name is Muhammad imran, i usually go by either Muhammad or Moey. This is my first Year at RMIT - i am currently studying Bachelors of Information Technology. Since high school, I have been interested in studying I.T or just like many of us i was interested in working on projects and making Programs, which is the main reason why i am at RMIT. I have a little experience with website development and a fair bit knowledge in coding. As mentioned earlier i have made several Apps in C#, which helped  master the language and now i can comfortably program in C#. 

<h1> Interests in I.T.</h1>
i have Studied Software development in highschool, which helped me with coding alot as my main interest in I.T is making programs which run efficiently and effectively. I have worked on different projects, some were group and some were indivdual which mainly involved coding using C#. i have been learning and coding on it for almost 2 1/2 years. So, my main interest in I.T is really simlpe and straight forward, as it is mainly conding or web designing.
